		<h1>Building websites as a group</h1>
		<p>Websites are almost never built by just one person. You usually need to work together with a team. That means you'll need to coordinate changes to the same files. As professionals, we use version control to coordinate changes, manage conflicts, and help everyone work together on the same code at the same time.</p>
		<p>This gets complicated quickly. Today, you'll begin to work with "git" to accept your first pull request. In the space below, add a new section with your name and a sentence about yourself. I'll get started.</p>
		<h2>Nate Wright</h2>

		<h2> Hi Harun</h2>
